# Module Inquiry 5

## Questions

1. Pick one team member. What is a piece of feedback you have yet to give them?
It would be great to have better communication such as stand ups, screen sharing, and discussing app logic and structure.
2. What's an example of some recent feedback you received that was easy to hear? What about recent feedback that was difficult to hear? What do you think made them easy or difficult to process?
Easy to hear that I should delegate out more work when working with more junior developers. Difficult to hear hear that I think my code is "precious" when confronting teammates that break my code. It's easy to hear feedback about something you did that you can do differently, it's difficult to hear characterizations if there is truth to them.
3. What's the most memorable feedback you've ever received? What was it about the feedback that made such an impact?
Best feedback I've recieved was to "not bite off more than I can chew", related to being overly ambitious in estimating the time it takes to accomplish something.
4. What do you think the difference is between constructive and non-constructive feedback?
This question is most likely looking for the "don't criticize without offering a solution" approach. Meaning good feedback is trying to make people better, rather than throwing criticism around.
